		<h1>Welcome to my page</h1>
		<p>Hello and welcome. I am very new to this web deveopment stuff and this is my learning area. I'm also even newer to the GitHub experience, so I learn as I go with all of it. </p>
		<p>My goal is to make this page really cool with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. As I learn different things I want to be able to incorporate them into this page and eventually have it be my testing area for my real pages or other projects that I want to work on. </p>
		<p>Please always be kind, and I will do the same. </p>
