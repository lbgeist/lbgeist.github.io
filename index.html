		<h1>Welcome to my page</h1>
		<p>Hello and welcome. I am very new to this web deveopment stuff and this is my learning area. I'm also even newer to the GitHub experience, so I learn as I go with all of it. </p>
		<p>My goal is to make this page really cool with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. As I learn different things I want to be able to incorporate them into this page and eventually have it be my testing area for my real pages or other projects that I want to work on. </p>
		<p>Please always be kind, and I will do the same. </p>
		
		<h2>I am learning!!!</h2>
		<p>Right now I am learning more about GIT and how it works. So I'm adding this information from my computer to test and see what happens on GitHub when I use Git to "push" the updated doc to GitHub. </p>
		<p>I'm really hoping to be able to add more interesting content on here soon. I've been doing a lot of thinking about what I would like to publish to my site, but I'm also really shy and don't want the whole world all up in my business. Not sure why I'm sharing THAT right now. . . but oh well. Let's see how this uploading and adding thing works out for me. </p>
		<p>OK. So I am still trying to figure out this whole Git thing and using it via the command line. So I need to add another line of text to try to learn a little more about what I am doing here. Seems like it's just so much easier to use the web interface, but I would really like to be able to do this programatically. I really don't think that's the right word if it is a word at all. I'm getting a spelling error so probably not.
