				<p class="about-me">I love learning. I love to know more today than I did know yesterday. Like for instance, today I learned a bunch about making this paragraph of text appear. It's an amazing feeling to be able to accomplish something. It makes me sad to think that other people don't care to learn new things. </p>
				<p class="about-me">But anyway, you don't want to hear about this. You want to know about me and my coding journey, and you might not even want to know that. I tend to babble when I am nervous. I'm kind of a shy person and don't really like to talk about myself. </p>
				<p class="about-me">I have been learning to code using the CS-50 course and the Codecademy courses. They have taught me a lot but there's still so much to learn. I have included some of the <a href="#projects">projects</a> that I've worked on while completing these courses. </p>
				<p class="about-me">As I've stated, I am a lifelong learner. One thing I would really like to learn and understand is design of web pages. I find that to be the most difficult thing in this journey so far. That and CSS but I'm starting to get a hang of it now. </p>
